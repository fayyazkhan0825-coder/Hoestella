# HOSTELLA – Smart Digital Outpass Management System

A Smart Digital Outpass Management System designed to automate hostel exit–entry permissions using QR Code, OTP verification, and real-time tracking.

## 📖 Project Overview

HOSTELLA is a university-based project developed to replace traditional paper-based hostel outpass systems with a secure, automated, and real-time digital solution.

The system allows:
- Students to submit digital outpass requests
- Parents to approve via OTP verification
- Wardens to authorize requests
- Security staff to scan QR codes at gates
- Real-time tracking of student movement

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional hostel outpass systems are:
- Paper-based and time-consuming
- Prone to loss and forgery
- Lacking real-time tracking
- Increasing administrative workload
- Risky for campus security

HOSTELLA solves these issues through automation and secure authentication.
